# @kal/menu-management

This is a menu-management-system project named `@kal/menu-management`, designed for running multiple apps (server and web) using `pnpm` in a monorepo structure. The project utilizes parallel running of development and start commands for a streamlined workflow.
The project starts by seeding a set of defined menus and sub menus to get you started quickly.

    ```
    Alternatively, the script `ensure` will install pnpm automatically if it's not already installed.

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: 
    To install all dependencies across all workspaces (server and web):
    ```bash
    pnpm run install-all
    ```


4. **Running in Development Mode**: 
    To start both the server and web apps in parallel:
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

5. **Building the Project**:
    To build the server and web apps:
    ```bash

    ```

6. **Starting the Project**: 
    To start both the server and web apps in parallel:
    ```bash
    pnpm run start
    ```

## Scripts

Here is a list of the available scripts and what they do:

- `dev`: Runs the development servers in parallel for both the `server` and `web` apps.
